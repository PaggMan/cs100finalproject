## Project Description

### Why is it important to us?
- We have all come across some sort of story game in our lives, so it would be interesting to understand how one works behind the scenes.
### What languages/tools/technologies do we plan to use?
- The majority of the project will be done C++. We also plan to use some external dependencies like [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) that will allow us to build terminal interfaces easily.
### What will be the input/output of your project?
- The input will be keys to navigate the menu and make choices, while the output will be story prompts displayed by the terminal.
### What are the features that the project provides?
- The project provides a menu, character customization, ability to save/restart the game, make choices that impact the path the game takes.
